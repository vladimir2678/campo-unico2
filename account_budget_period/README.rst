=============
Budget Period
=============

This module allows to manage budgets by range of periods.
In the budgets form, the start and stop dates are replaced with
start and stop periods.

The start and stop dates are still kept in the database as
they are converted to stored related fields.

Both periods and dates can be used for the analysis.
