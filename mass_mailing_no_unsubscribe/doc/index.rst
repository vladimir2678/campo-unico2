The mass mailing features of Odoo assume that your system is connected to the internet.
This means that the standard unsubscribe link added to marketing mails might not work properly.

This module removes the default unsubscribe link, allowing you to replace it with your own unsubscribe method.

General note that has no direct relation to this module: be aware that your marketing metrics will be influenced because you are not connected to the internet.
