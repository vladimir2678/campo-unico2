==========================
Partner Companies Relation
==========================

The standard Odoo already provides a parent-child relation between
partners, so that a partner (usually a company) can have many contacts.

This module adds a parent-child relation for partners to handle relations between companies.
By separating the companies relation with the existing contacts relation, this
module separates also the corresponding views, allowing to manage separately:

#. Contacts
#. Companies relations



Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. No configuration needed. Just install the module.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Open a partner form.
#. You will notice 2 tabs: one is for the contacts and one for the related companies.
