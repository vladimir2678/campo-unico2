Budgetary Position Periods
==========================

This module allows to manage budgetary position lines by range of periods.
In the budgetary position form, the start and stop dates of the lines are
replaced with start and stop periods.

The start and stop dates are still kept in the database as
they are converted to stored related fields.

Both periods and dates can be used for the analysis.
