==================
Budget Cost Center
==================

This module allows to link budgets, budgetary positions and forecasts to costcenters.
Setting a budget and a budgetary position at a costcenter creates an extra dimension
in reporting, customers can now compare the practical amounts to the planned amounts
and adjust the budget or the forecast.

The budget on a cost center can be for a certain period, f.e. a year or a quarter.

Budgetary positions are based on accounts, and budgets of different Cost Centers can be
linked to the same budgetary positions. This creates three layers of information:
Cost Center, Budget and Budgetary position. With these three layers itâ€™s possible
to compare Cost Centers, Budgets within Cost Center or budgets across Cost Centers, and
budgetary positions within budgets, within Cost Centers or across Cost Centers.
