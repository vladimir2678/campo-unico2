=============
Budget Totals
=============

This module adds the Forecast field in the budget.

This module also adds some other fields that will be used for
analysis and reporting, like: 'Planned amount', 'Practical amount',
and '% practical/planned'.

The fields 'Planned amount' and 'Practical amount' are just
the sum of the corresponding fields in the budget lines.
Anyway with this module, both the fields are now stored and
they can be handy to be used for reporting analysis.
